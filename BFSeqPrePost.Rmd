# Motivation

The article of @Gajewski2022 discusses a two-stage adaptive Bayesian trial design with a continuous primary endpoint and one secondary endpoint. The endpoints were defined as the difference between a post-intervention measurement and a pre-intervention measurement. The authors specify rules for early stopping for efficacy or futility based on the posterior distribution for both endpoints jointly. One limitation of the study from @Gajewski2022 is the definition of the study endpoints as the difference between the post-intervention measurement and the pre-intervention measurement. Because of the correlation between both measurements there exists a regression to the mean effect @Vickers1123. 

In the current simulation study we investigate operational characteristics of simulated trials.
