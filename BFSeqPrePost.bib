abstract = {Our randomized controlled clinical trial will explore the potential of bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogen to modulate breast tissue-based risk biomarkers as a surrogate for breast cancer risk reduction. This paper investigates the statistical design features of the trial and the rationale for the final choice of its design. Group sequential designs are a popular design approach to allow a trial to stop early for success or futility, potentially saving time and money over a fixed trial design. While Bayesian adaptive designs enjoy the same properties as group sequential designs, they have the added benefit of using prior information as well as inferential interpretation conditional on the data. Whether a frequentist or Bayesian trial, most adaptive designs have interim analyses that allow for early stopping, typically utilizing only the primary endpoint. A drawback to this approach is that the study may not have enough data for adequate comparisons of a single, key secondary endpoint. This can happen, for example, if the secondary endpoint has a smaller effect than the primary endpoint.},

@article{Schonbrodt2018,
abstract = {A sizeable literature exists on the use of frequentist power analysis in the null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm to facilitate the design of informative experiments. In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either $\mathcal {H}_{1}$or $\mathcal {H}_{0}$, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},
