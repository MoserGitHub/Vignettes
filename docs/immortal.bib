    abstract = "{The authors compared five methods of studying survival bias associated with time-to-treatment initiation in a drug effectiveness study using medical administrative databases (1996–2002) from Quebec, Canada. The first two methods illustrated how survival bias could be introduced. Three additional methods were considered to control for this bias. Methods were compared in the context of evaluating statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients post-acute myocardial infarction who initiated statins within 90 days after discharge and those who did not. Method 1 that classified patients into users and nonusers at discharge resulted in an overestimation of the benefit (38\\% relative risk reduction at 1 year). In method 2, following users from the time of the first prescription and nonusers from a randomly selected time between 0 and 90 days attenuated the effect toward the null (10\\% relative risk reduction). Method 3 controlled for survival bias by following patients from the end of the 90-day time window; however, it suffered a major loss of statistical efficiency and precision. Method 4 matched prescription time distribution between users and nonusers at cohort entry. Method 5 used a time-dependent variable for treatment initiation. Methods 4 and 5 better controlled for survival bias and yielded similar results, suggesting a 20\\% risk reduction of recurrent myocardial infarction or death events.}",

The emulation of the target trial may fail when researchers deviate from simple principles that guide the design and analysis of randomized experiments. We review a framework to describe and prevent biases, including immortal time bias, that result from a failure to align start of follow-up, specification of eligibility, and treatment assignment. We review some analytic approaches to avoid these problems in comparative effectiveness or safety research.}

abstract = {Abstract Purpose Recent observational studies suggest that various drugs are remarkably effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These cohort studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis which can lead to immortal time bias. We describe the bias from 20 of these studies and illustrate it by showing that unrelated drugs can be made to appear effective at treating cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods The illustration used a cohort of 3315 patients, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), identified from the Saskatchewan Health databases, hospitalised for CVD and followed for up to a year. We used the biased approach to assess the effect of two medications, namely gastrointestinal drugs (GID) and inhaled beta-agonists (IBA), both unknown to be effective in CVD, on the risk of all-cause mortality. We also estimated these effects using the proper person-time approach. Results Using the inappropriate approach, the rates ratios of all-cause death were 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.57–0.93), with IBA and 0.78 (95\%CI: 0.61–0.99), with GID. These rate ratios became 0.98 (95\%CI: 0.77–1.25) and 0.94 (95\%CI: 0.73–1.20), respectively, with the proper person-time analysis. Conclusions Several recent observational studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis, leading to immortal time bias, which can generate an illusion of treatment effectiveness. Observational studies, with surprising beneficial drug effects should be re-assessed to account for this source of bias. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract = "{Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment—the target experiment or target trial—that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.}",
